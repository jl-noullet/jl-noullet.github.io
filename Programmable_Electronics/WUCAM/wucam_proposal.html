<h1>IATSED Transversal Project<br>
Proposal for 2025</h1>
<i>Jean-Louis Noullet</i>

<p>For the purpose of simulation, the model of a complex system is usually split into a number of software modules, some representing components of the system and some representing the communication links between these components.</p>
<p>In the initial phase of a project, simplified models are used and all modules may run on a single computer.<br>
Later, in order to improve realism or broaden the range of observable use cases, more refined modules may gradually be plugged into the system.</p>

<p>In this context, the concept of "hardware in the loop" is sometimes put in action, consisting of replacing a software module of the simulation by a hardware component.</p>
<p>Some examples of benefits expected from this approach are :
<ul>
<li>improved realism</i>
<li>discovery of difficulties which are overlooked by software models</li>
<li>more convincing prof of concept</li>
<li>validation of a real life hardware prototype.</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Proposed contribution of Programmable Electronics</h3>

<p>This contribution will be an illustration of the <b>"hardware in the loop"</b> concept.</p>
<p>The airborne system will be emulated by a remote electronic module, the WUCAM (Wireless Unmanned Cargo Aircraft Model), communicating with the ground system by means of a real radio link.</p>
<p>On the ground side, the main simulation program, running on a personal computer, will have access to this wireless link through a microcontroller based radio module, connected to the personal computer via an USB link.</p>

<h3>Implementation details</h3>

<p>The WUCAM will be available, ready to use.</p>
<p>The ground based module will consist of an Arduino board (fitted with an ATMEL ATmega328 microcontroller), bearing a radio board fitted with a Texas Instruments CC1101 UHF radio chip with antenna.</p>
<p>The students will have to develop the software on the PC side (Java) and on the ATmega328 (C++) in order to:
<ul>
<li>transmit APDLC pilot orders to the WUCAM in a secure way (i.e. with error detection and lost message retransmission)</li>
<li>receive AAR reports from the WUCAM</li>
<li>transmit simulation directives to the WUCAM</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Components of the ATmega328 firmware will be developed and tested during the Programmable Electronics lab sessions.</p>
<p class="bk">These sessions will address :
<ul>
<li>communication with the personal computer by means of an asynchronous serial link over USB (a generic terminal emulator will be used on the PC side)</li>
<li>communication with the radio chip by mean of the SPI bus</li>
<li>measurement of radio parameters, frequency calibration</li>
<li>computation of CRC error detection binary words</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Overview of the WUCAM specification</h3>

<p>The goal of the WUCAM is to provide simulation capabilities equivalent to those provided by the software solution Rejeu, limited
to those required by the operational scenarios of the project.</p>
<p>Radio parameters :
<ul>
<li>unlicensed UHF band EU433 (433.05 MHz to 434.79 MHz), power &lt; 10mW, channel occupation &lt; 10%</li>
<li>hardware formatted packets, variable length up to 61 bytes</li>
<li>half-duplex transceivers, with clear channel assignment</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Supported messages :
<ul>
<li>Pilot commands
<ul>
<li>flight plan upload (list of waypoints)</li>
<li>flight level change (CPDLC 20) with optional climb rate</li>
<li>turn to new heading (CPDLC 94)</li> 
<li>proceed direct to waypoint (CPDLC 74)</li>
<li>resume flight plan</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Periodic report contents
<ul>
<li>timestamp (1s resolution)</li>
<li>position in Cautra coordinates system (like Rejeu)</li>
<li>barometric altitude</li>
<li>heading</li>
<li>ground speed</li>
</ul></li>
<li>On-demand reports
<ul>
<li>current flight plan</li>
<li>known waypoints coordinates</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Simulation directives
<ul>
<li>pause-resume</li>
<li>periodic reports period (min 1s)</li>
<li>simulation acceleration coefficient (like Rejeu)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></p>
