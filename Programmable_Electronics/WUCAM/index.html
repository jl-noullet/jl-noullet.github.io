<h1>WUCAM (Wireless Unmanned Cargo Aircraft Model)</h1>
<i>Jean-Louis Noullet - ENAC 2025</i>

<p>For the purpose of simulation, the model of a complex system is usually split into a number of software modules, some representing components of the system and some representing the communication links between these components.</p>
<p>In the initial phase of a project, simplified models are used and all modules may run on a single computer.<br>
Later, in order to improve realism or broaden the range of observable use cases, more refined modules may gradually be plugged into the system.</p>

<p>In this context, the concept of "hardware in the loop" is sometimes put in action, consisting of replacing a software module of the simulation by a hardware component.</p>
<p>Some examples of benefits expected from this approach are :
<ul>
<li>improved realism</i>
<li>discovery of difficulties which are overlooked by software models</li>
<li>more convincing prof of concept</li>
<li>validation of a real life hardware prototype.</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>The airborne system model</h3>

<p>The airborne system is emulated by an autonomous electronic module, the WUCAM (Wireless Unmanned Cargo Aircraft Model), which does not fly but contains a simple flight simulator, able to communicate with the ground system by means of a real radio link.</p>
<p>On the ground side, the main simulation program, running on a personal computer, will have access to this wireless link through a microcontroller based radio module, connected to the personal computer via an USB link.</p>

<h3>Implementation details</h3>

<p>The WUCAM is provided, already programmed with a firmware ready for a virtual flight.</p>
<p>The ground based module will consist of an Arduino board (fitted with an ATMEL ATmega328 microcontroller), bearing a radio board fitted with a CC1101 UHF digital radio chip with antenna.</p>
<p>The students will have to develop the software on the PC side (Java) and on the ATmega328 (C++) in order to:
<ul>
<li>transmit APDLC pilot orders to the WUCAM in a secure way (i.e. with error detection and lost message retransmission)</li>
<li>receive AAR reports from the WUCAM</li>
<li>transmit simulation directives to the WUCAM</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>WUCAM limitations</h3>

<p>The goal of the WUCAM is to provide simulation capabilities equivalent to those provided by the software simulator Rejeu, limited
to those required by the operational scenarios of the project.</p>
<p>Notably take-off, final approach and landing are not supported in the current version.</p>

<p>The WUCAM is reachable by means of a short range radio link using the unlicensed UHF band EU433 (433.05 MHz to 434.79 MHz), with constraints on transmitted power and channel occupation, limiting the size of messages and forcing a very compact encoding of data</p>
