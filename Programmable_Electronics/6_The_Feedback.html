<h1>6. The Feedback</h1>
</center>
<div class="boite">
<img class="rightim" src="feedback.png">
<p>Feedback systems are also known as closed-loop systems, where some output signal is fed back to a control input.</p>
<p>Feedback is essential to control theory and control engineering, nevertheless it also exists in nature.</p>
<p>This chapter presents feedback examples based on analog circuits, but mixed analog-digital feedback systems including
control by software are current.</p>
</div>
<h2>6.1 Negative feedback</h2>
<div class="boite">
<img class="rightim" src="steam_engine_governor.jpg">
<p>The goal of a negative feedback loop (also known as servo, regulator or governor) is to keep the ouput of the system in accordance with an external input signal (set value), even in the presence of random perturbations</p>

<p>In a negative feedback loop, the feedback signal is subtracted from the from the set value, then the difference (error signal) is amplified to control the output</p>
<p>A greater amplification gain will provide a better rejection of the perturbations and a better accuracy of control, but an excess of gain can make the system unstable.</p>
</div>

<h3>6.1.1 Regulated current source</h3>
<div class="boite">
<img class="rightim" src="cur_src_sch.png">
<p>The collector current Ic of a bipolar transistor is controlled by the base-to-emitter voltage Vbe with a very high gain.<br> But this control is non-linear and the current also strongly depends on the temperature and the process variations, in such a way that controlling the collector current in open loop is not feasible.</p>
<p>With a high gain transistor, the emitter current is nearly equal to the collector current, so the voltage across Re can be used as a feedback signal. In this circuit, Vbe is the difference between Vsv (the set value) and the voltage across Re, so Vbe is the error signal which will be amplified by the transistor.</p>
</div>

<div class="nob">
<p>The input source Vsv is swept from 1 Volt to 3 Volts, and this is repeated for temperatures 10째C, 30째C and 50째C.</p>
<img src="cur_src.png">
<p>Results: the output current is controlled linearly by the set value, with a constant slope close to 10mA/V, consistent with the value of Re, the temperature variations cause a large offset of Vbe but a moderate shift of Ic.</p>

<h3>6.1.2 Operational amplifier basic circuits</h3>
<p>The operational amplifier is a differential amplifier, built as an integrated circuit containing many transistors. It amplifies the potential difference between its inputs with a very high gain, in such a way that when the feedback is working, this difference is so small that it can be neglected.</p>
<p>The name "operational" comes from the fact that this amplifier was created for making the "operator modules" in the analog calculators.</p>
<p>The practical behaviour of the operational amplifier is entirely determined by the feedback circuit, which allows a great number of applications, the best known being the inverting amplifier and the non-inverting amplifier.</p>
<div class="boite">
<div class="leftim"><img src="inv_amp.png" style="display: inline"> <img src="non_inv_amp.png" style="display: inline"></div>
<p>Note that if R2=0 in the non-inverting circuit, the gain G is 1 and R1 can be removed, this is the "voltage follower" circuit.</p>

<img class="rightim" src="weight_add_sch.png">

<p>The next example is a weighted adding-inverting circuit, it produces the sum of two signals with different negative gains (-10.0 and -3.33 in the example).</p>
<p>To predict the output voltage, one has to consider that :</p>
<ul><li>the input current of the opamp is negligible, so the sum of the currents in R1, R2, R3 is zero</li>
<li>the differential input voltage is negligible, so the voltage at em is zero</li>
</ul>

<h2>6.2 Positive feedback</h2>
<p>Ideally, a sufficient positive feedback creates an unbounded increase of the signal, <br>
in practice the amplifying element will reach its limit, which is called saturation or clipping</p>
<ul><li>if the feedback path includes the DC component, the amplifier will get saturated either at its maximum output or at its minimum output, until an exterior event causes it to flip the other way</li>
<li>if the feedback path has a narrow bandwidth, the amplifier may  become oscillating with an increased amplitude, which will be limited by clipping</li>
</ul>
<h3>6.2.1 Schmitt trigger</h3>
<div class="boite">
<img class="rightim" src="trigger_sch.png">
<p>A trigger is a circuit which has only 2 stable output states, it is useful for processing input signals for digital circuits.</p>
<p>The Schmitt trigger is an amplifier with an attenuated DC feedback, in such a way that its flipping threshold (which is voltage at node ep) changes according to its output state.</p>
<p>Such a behaviour is called hysteresis.</p>
</div>

<div class="nob">
<p>In the example, the thresholds are approximately -0.9 V and 0.9 V. It is observed that when the input signal does not cross these thresholds, the trigger ignores it.</p>

<h3>6.2.2 Wien bridge Oscillator</h3>
<img src="wien_osc_sch.png">
<p>The Wien bandpass filter (left drawing) will be used in the feedback loop, with the goal of making an oscillator producing a sinewave. A preliminary AC simulation will be used to check the behaviour of the filter alone, made of 2 identical resistors R1 and R2 and 2 identical capacitors C1 and C2.</p>

<img src="wien_osc_1.png">
<p>The AC simulation shows that the filter has a maximum output of -9.54dB at 2.324 kHz, with a phase close to 0째.<br> The theoretical output is 1/3, which is -9.5424 dB in good agreement with the simulation.</p>


<div class="nob">
<p>In order to start the oscillation, the amplifier must have a gain greater than 3, but not too much to avoid saturation.<br> In the example, this is done by combining an operational amplifier with a negative feedback provided by R6 and R7.</p>
<p>The simulator tends to rest on a metastable state instead of oscillating (this does not happen in real life). <br>To start the oscillation, a current source Istart provides a short pulse.</p>
<img src="wien_osc_2.png">
<p>An oscillation is observed at the predicted frequency, with an amplitude increasing until saturation.<br>
The saturation causes a distortion of the signal, which could be reduced by means of a amplitude regulation
loop.</p>
