<h1>2. The Analogies</h1>
</center>
<p>The most complete analogies between electricity and other domains of physics are those which extend to systems represented by differential equations of the second degree. But some which are limited to the first degree are useful too.</p>
<p>To establish an analogy, one has to select two fundamental quantities similar to voltage and current. It his helpful but not mandatory to select one which represent a potential (something rather static, which has the power of action but may remain idle), and the other which represents a flow, something in motion</p>
<p>In electricity, the quantity which is commonly named voltage is more precisely the "electric potential difference" and in some cases "electromotive force".<br>It is worth remarking that the french word for voltage is "tension", which means "static traction", while the chinese word for voltage is 电压 which mean "electric pressure".</p>
<p>The scientists who created this vocabulary for electricity were surely inspired by the hydraulic analogy, this is the one to begin with.</p>

<h2>2.1 The Hydraulic Analogy</h2>
<p>When a mass is lifted to a higher altitude, its gravitational potential is increased, at the cost of some energy.</p>
<p>An altitude difference in a fluid like water creates a pressure, which in turn creates a force when applied to a given solid area.</p>
<p>So the analogy between voltage and altitude or pressure, seems very consistent with the vocabulary, coming together with the analogy between electric current and fluid flow</p>
<p>To make the analogy work, we need first to state that the fluid density and the gravitational acceleration are fixed.<br>
Then we may represent the potential as a pressure or as a height, and the flow as a volume flow or a mass flow, these choices are arbitrary.<br>

<h3>2.1.1 Legacy analogy</h3>
<div class="boite">
<img class="rightim" src="hydraulic_analogy_1.png">
<p>The first table "legacy" is established with height and mass flow as fundamental quantities,
with kgf as force unit (apologies to Mr Newton) in order to keep the equations simpler</p>

<table class="bw">
<tr><td><i>Hydraulic domain (legacy units)</i></td><td><i>Electrical domain</i></td></tr>     
<tr><td>Pressure (m) h</td><td>Voltage (V) V</td></tr>     
<tr><td>Flow (kg/s) f</td><td>Current (A) I</td></tr>     
<tr><td>Quantity of fluid (kg) M = f*t</td><td>Electric Charge (C) Q = I*t</td></tr>     
<tr><td>Energy (kgf.m) W = M*h = h*f*t</td><td>Energy (J) W = V*Q = V*I*t</td></tr>     
<tr><td>Power (kgf.m/s) P = h*f = W/t</td><td>Power (W) P = V*I = W/t</td></tr>     
<tr><td>Restriction R = h/f</td><td>Resistor(Ω) R = V/I</td></tr>     
<tr><td>Tank "area" (kgf/m) A = M/h</td><td>Capacitance (F) C = Q/V = I/(dV/dT)</td></tr>

<p>The bucket elevator was chosen in the example picture because it demonstrates clearly the transformation of the mecanical energy applied to the lower pulley into potential energy recived by the water.</p>
<p>When the valve R is closed, the relative pressure that it blocks is proportional to the height h, regardless of its own altitude.</p>

<p>If the valve is slightly open, it creates a restriction which acts like a resistor, determining the h/f ratio and converting the h*f power into heat.<br>
This is a little harder to figure out, since the heat is immediateley carried away by the fluid and we do not observe any local temperature increase at the valve itself.</p>

<h3>2.1.2 SI analogy</h3>
<p>This second table "SI units" is established with pressure and mass flow as fundamental quantities,<br>
wich the help of two constant coefficients :</p>
<ul><li>The gravity coefficient (acceleration) g (M/s²)</li>
<li>The density of the fluid d (kg/m<sup>3</sup>)</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.1.3 The hydraulic resonator</h3>
<p>A resonator or "2nd order system" is made by the combination of two devices that exchange energy, on storing energy by integration of the flow ("static storage"), the other one by integration of the potential ("inertial storage").</p>
<p>The communicating vessels are the hydraulic analogue of the RLC circuit, where two tanks store energy by gravity ("static storage"), while the accelerated fluid in the pipe stores kinetic energy. The friction in the pipe creates the dissipative element which damps the oscillation, like R</p>
