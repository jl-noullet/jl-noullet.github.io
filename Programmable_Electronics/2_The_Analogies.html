<h1>2. The Analogies</h1>
</center>
<p>The most complete analogies between electricity and other domains of physics are those which extend to systems represented by differential equations of the second degree. But some which are limited to the first degree are useful too.</p>
<p>To establish an analogy, one has to select two fundamental quantities similar to voltage and current. It his helpful but not mandatory to select one which represent a potential (something rather static, which has the power of action but may remain idle), and the other which represents a flow, something in motion</p>
<p>In electricity, the quantity which is commonly named voltage is more precisely the "electric potential difference" and in some cases "electromotive force".<br>It is worth remarking that the french word for voltage is "tension", which means "static traction", while the chinese word for voltage is 电压 which mean "electric pressure".</p>
<p>The scientists who created this vocabulary for electricity were surely inspired by the hydraulic analogy, this is the one to begin with.</p>

<h2>2.1 The Hydraulic Analogy</h2>
<p>When a mass is lifted to a higher altitude, its gravitational potential is increased, at the cost of some energy.</p>
<p>An altitude difference in a fluid like water creates a pressure, which in turn creates a force when applied to a given solid area.</p>
<p>So the analogy between voltage and altitude or pressure, seems very consistent with the vocabulary, coming together with the analogy between electric current and fluid flow</p>
<p>To make the analogy work, we need first to state that the fluid density and the gravitational acceleration are fixed.<br>
Then we may represent the potential as a pressure or as a height, and the flow as a volume flow or a mass flow, these choices are arbitrary.<br>

<h3>2.1.1 Legacy analogy</h3>
<div class="boite">
<img class="rightim" src="hydraulic_analogy_1.png">
<p>The first table "legacy" is established with height and mass flow as fundamental quantities,
with kgf as force unit (apologies to Mr Newton) in order to keep the equations simpler</p>

<table class="bw">
<tr><td><i>Hydraulic domain (legacy units)</i></td><td><i>Electrical domain</i></td></tr>     
<tr><td>Pressure (m) h</td><td>Voltage (V) V</td></tr>     
<tr><td>Flow (kg/s) f</td><td>Current (A) I</td></tr>

<tr><td>Inertial pipe j = h/(df/dt)</td><td>Inductance (H) L = V/(dI/dt)</td></tr>     
</table>
<p>The bucket elevator was chosen in the example picture because it demonstrates clearly the transformation of the mecanical energy applied to the lower pulley into potential energy recived by the water.</p>
<p>When the valve R is closed, the relative pressure that it blocks is proportional to the height h, regardless of its own altitude.</p>

<p>If the valve is slightly open, it creates a restriction which acts like a resistor, determining the h/f ratio and converting the h*f power into heat.<br>
This is a little harder to figure out, since the heat is immediateley carried away by the fluid and we do not observe any local temperature increase at the valve itself.</p>

<h3>2.1.2 SI analogy</h3>
<p>This second table "SI units" is established with pressure and mass flow as fundamental quantities,<br>
wich the help of two constant coefficients :</p>
<ul><li>The gravity coefficient (acceleration) g (M/s²)</li>
<li>The density of the fluid d (kg/m<sup>3</sup>)</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.1.3 The hydraulic resonator</h3>
<p>A resonator or "2nd order system" is made by the combination of two devices that exchange energy, on storing energy by integration of the flow ("static storage"), the other one by integration of the potential ("inertial storage").</p>
<img src="reson_vessels.png" style="display: inline"><img src="reson_sch.png" style="display: inline">
<p>A pair of communicating vessels are the hydraulic analogue of the RLC circuit, where two tanks store energy by gravity ("static storage"), while the accelerated fluid in the pipe stores kinetic energy. The friction in the pipe constitutes the dissipative element which damps the oscillation, like R</p>
<img src="reson_waves.png">
<p>With the valve closed, the tank are filled with h1 > h2. Then at time 0 the valve is fully opened. The fluid flows to the right, until h2 = h1. At that point the potential difference is zero, but all the energy is now stored as kinetic energy in the pipe, allowing h2 to become higher than h1, causing a deceleration of the flow, and so on.</p> 

<h3>2.1.4 Other basic hydraulic circuits</h3>
<img src="hydraulic_circuits.png">
<p>From the left to the right:</p>
<ul><li>a closed circuit: the generator-motor combination :
<ul><li>the first bucket elevator behaves like an electric generator: it generates hydraulic power from mechanical power</li>
<li>the second one behaves like a motor, it converts hydraulic power back to mechanical power, available at the shaft of its lower pulley (a variant of the well-known water wheel)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>the series combination: the height (or pressure) add, while the flow is common, like in series electric circuits where the voltages add while the current is common</li>
<li>the parallel combination: the flows add, while the height is common, like in parallel electric circuits where the currents add while the voltage is common</li>
</ul>

<h2>2.2 The Mechanical Analogies</h2>

<h3>2.2.1 The Mechanical analogy of the first kind</h3>
<p>This analogy is close to the hydraulic analogy previously presented, with force replacing pressure and velocity replacing fluid flow.<br>It is well known from the analogy between the spring-mass resonator and the RLC circuit.</p>

<h3>2.2.2 The mass-spring resonator</h3>
<div class="boite">
<div class="rightim">
<img src="mass_spring_damper.png">
<img src="RLC.png">
</div>
<p>Everytime something is vibrating, the spring-mass system is involved. Since every physical system loses energy by some way, we should consider a mass-spring-damper system, the analogue of the RLC circuit</p>

<p>The theoretical diagrams use to represent the damper as piston in a cylinder with some leakage. This comes from the dampers used to shorten unwanted resonance of many mechanical systems, like the suspension of a car.</p>
<p>This damping is called "viscous friction" because it involves a fluid (liquid or gas), providing a linear (proportional) action like its analogue, the resistor. (Solid friction is more difficult to model, being strongly non-linear).<br>Friction with the air contributes to the damping of every vibration.</p>
<p>When it is not too much damped, the system has a resonating frequency<br>
ω = sqrt(k/M) = sqrt(1/L*C) in rad/s<br>
(multiply by 2Π for converting to Herz)</p>
<p>Note: on the mechanical drawing, the damper and the spring look like they are in parallel. In fact the three elements share the same displacement x (analogue of current) while the forces (analogue of voltage) are added, so this is equivalent to electric elements in series.</p>

<h3>2.2.3 The rotational variant</h3>
<div class="boite">
<img class="rightim" src="balance_wheel.jpg">
<p>A similar mechanical analogy can be defined for rotating mechanisms : </p>
<ul><li>force is replaced by torque</li>
<li>velocity is replaced by rotational speed (angular velocity)</li>
<li>displacement is replaced by angle</li>
<li>and so on</li>
</ul>
<p>A familiar example of a rotational resonator is the balance wheel used in mechanical watches and clocks.<br>
With minimal damping, the frequency of its oscillation is precise enough to be the reference for time measurement. The mechanism called escapement provides just enough energy to compensate the damping caused by friction.<br>
Similarly, LC oscillators are composed of a RLC resonator associated with a feedback circuitry which provides energy to compensate the losses.</p>
